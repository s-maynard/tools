tools
=====

The first tool added here is genautotools.pl, a perl script that parses a
directory and recurses into its subdirectories to create the autotools
files required for use with autoreconf, autoconf, automake, etc.
once run, you should be able to execute:<br>
<br>
<i>
./autogen.sh<br>
make<br>
make install<br>
<i/>
