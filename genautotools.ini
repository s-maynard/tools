# This ini file holds values for the genautotools.pl script that parses a
# directory and recurses into its subdirectories to create the autotools
# files required for use with autoreconf, autoconf, automake, etc.
# once run, you should be able to execute:
#
# ./autogen.sh
# make
# make install
#
# Issues, comments, and patches are welcome at github.com/s-maynard/tools
